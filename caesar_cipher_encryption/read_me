The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and oldest methods of encryption, named after Julius Caesar, who is
historically known to have used it to communicate confidential information. It is a substitution cipher 
where each letter in the plain text is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

# How it works
1. Shift Operations:
- Choose a shift value , often referred to as the "key" or "shift".
- For example , with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E' and so on.

2. Encryption:
- Each letter in the plaintext is replaced by the letter that is a fixed number of position
down the alphabet
- Non-alphabetic characters(e.g., numbers, punctuation) remains unchanged.

3. Decryption:
- To decrypt , the same process is applied in reverse. The cipher text is shifted backward by the same amount.
